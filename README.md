# EconMF
Economy system created using the Mineflow for PMMP 5.

# Features
- Easy to use either by commands or forms.
- Configuration file that stores the data.
- Interactive bank.
- Same features of the Bedrock Economy or the defunct EconomyAPI.

# Variables
The following are the global variables that can be used if you want to adapt them to another Mineflow recipe:
- {money{target.name}} - Get the target's money.

# Plans for future updates
- Add a leaderboard that shows the top.
- Add a json UI to forms to add style.
