# EconMF [Under development] [No release yet]
The largest and most complex economic system created using the Mineflow v3.3.0 for PMMP 5.

**Note: If you want to edit the configurations, I recommend you first see the _econfig.yml_ example left in the repository**

# Features
- Easy to use either by commands or forms.
- Configuration file that stores the data.
- Completely custom configuration.
- Interactive bank.
- Same features of the Bedrock Economy or the defunct EconomyAPI.
- Versatility for Mineflow developers.

# Setup
1. Install the latest version of Mineflow on your PMMP server.
2. Import the json file into the directory: plugin data/Mineflow/imports.
3. Import the recipes using the Mineflow interface.
4. Use the "/econfig" command to create the EconMF configuration file.
5. Enjoy it :).

# Commands
- /econ ~ Basic command of the EconMF.
- /econ help ~ Discover the EconMF commands.
- /econ bank ~ Open the form to use EconMF in a more interactive way (configurable).
- /econ bal [user] ~ See your balance or the balance of others (configurable).
- /econ pay (user) (amount) ~ Pay a player a specific amount of money (configurable).
**OP Commands**

# For other Mineflow developers
There are instructions in the file [formfdevs.md](https://github.com/NecroSama8/EconMF/blob/main/formfdevs.md) if you want to use the system API ;).

# Plans for future updates
- Create mechanisms compatible with this system.
- Add settings for messages and command names.
- Add a leaderboard that shows the top.
- Add a json UI to forms to add style.
